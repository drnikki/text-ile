# README
Text-ile is a repository for text-based pattern printing to be used in the 20th anniversary HASTAC scuplture.

## Running locally
To work on the code locally, you can use any text editor you normally use to work with JavaScript.  As we have been testing various libraries and modules, we've encoutered some CORS errors.  The fastest way around this is to view the project from a local server.

In VSCode, you can install the "Live Server" extension.  Starting a live server will sidestep any CORS issues.

## Contribution Workflow
1. go to the issue queue and find an issue you'd like to work on
2. Assign that issue to yourself so that everyone knows you're taking it
3. Click on the "create a branch" link in the issue.  All of your code for the issue will go onto that branch.
4. (write code!)
5. When you're done, make sure all of your code is committed to your branch and pushed to origin. 
6. Open a pull request, explain your changes, and assign the PR to Nikki
