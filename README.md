# README
Text-ile is a repository for text-based pattern printing to be used in the 20th anniversary HASTAC scuplture.

## Running locally
To work on the code locally, you can use any text editor you normally use to work with JavaScript (VSCode is what Nikki uses).  As we have been testing various libraries and modules, we've encoutered some CORS errors.  The fastest way around this is to view the project from a local server.

In VSCode, you can install the "Live Server" extension.  Starting a live server will sidestep any CORS issues.
