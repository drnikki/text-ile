# README

Text-ile is a tool developed to help artists visualize text-based patterns on receipt paper.  

## Running locally

To work on the code locally, you can use any text editor you normally use to work with JavaScript (VSCode is what Nikki uses). As we have been testing various libraries and modules, we've encountered some CORS errors. The fastest way around this is to view the project from a local server.



## Contributing
(basic intro)

In VSCode, you can install the "Live Server" extension. Starting a live server will sidestep any CORS issues.

## Contribution Workflow

1. Once you've found an issue to work on.... (see next section)
2. Assign that issue to yourself so that everyone knows you're taking it
3. Click on the "create a branch" link in the issue. All of your code for the issue will go onto that branch.
4. (write code!)
5. When you're done, make sure all of your code is committed to your branch and pushed to origin.
6. Open a pull request, explain your changes, and assign the PR to Nikki
